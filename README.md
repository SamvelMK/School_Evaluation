# Project Title: Evaluation of the E-Learning Program on Adolescentsâ€™ Reproductive Health
## Principal Investigator: Samvel Mkhitaryan, MPH, MS
## National expert: Anush Alexanyan, MA
## Contracting Party: UNFPA Armenia CO.   

Given the challenges pertaining to the delivery of the school-based program on Reproductive Health (RH), particularly related to the difficulties in delivering sensitive topics to students and the need for continuous teacher training programs, the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) in Armenia initiated an e-learning module on reproductive health and rights for school children. The e-learning program retains the content of the current school-based program while adopting the in-class activities to an interactive e-learning format. Thus, the e-learning program has several advantages. Firstly, it is relatively cost effective and does not require continuous teacher training. Secondly, the selective omission of topics by the teachers during the delivery of the program is eliminated. Thirdly, the e-learning program will provide continuous data on the effectiveness of the program and will thereby indicate the areas of improvement.
In the present project we will evaluate the effectiveness of the program in meeting its goals. The evaluation methodology is composed of two components: 1) a formative evaluation, and 2) a summative evaluation. More details on the evaluation methodology can be found in the SRHR_ELearning_methodology.doc file.
